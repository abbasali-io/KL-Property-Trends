## What are we looking for?
- Let's find the up-scale areas in Kuala Lumpur according to the pricing!
- Where in the city, do people make bigger houses?
- Most expensive areas in Kuala Lumpur to live!

## Files
The main files are in the root directory.
- kuala_lumpur_data_analysis.ipynb (Jupyter file, main file for data analysis)

- kl_property_data.csv (data acquired from Kaggle from above url)
- Folder => screenshots (screenshots and images used in the blog)

# Results of Analysis
We analyzed the property trends and found that there are few upscale areas, and most of the upscale areas are due to the larger property sizes. However, the KLCC (twin towers) and the city center areas are quite expensive, even with smaller spaces.
